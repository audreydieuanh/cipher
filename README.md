# Classical encryption

Name: **Dieu-Anh (Audrey) Trinh**

## Description
This submission includes two programs, VigenereCipher and CaesarCipher that decode and encode string provided by users in the command line arguments and print errors if users' input is invalid.

## Change for first redo
In both files
1. Change variable names:
   1.1 m -> key
   1.2 charArr -> message (main method)
   1.3 str -> message (encodeOrdecode method)

2. Change method implementation:
Since encode and decode is mostly similar. The only difference is to add/subtract, I group it into 1 method to remove repeated code.
